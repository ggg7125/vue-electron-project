i need to "sign the app" as explained here or Windows will give people many problems trying to run it: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v10.1.1/docs/tutorial/code-signing.md

electron can detect if internet is online/offline which we can use to know if our bot should pause itself until internet comes back on

electron can send desktop notifications so i could use them to show the user their trades https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v10.1.1/docs/tutorial/notifications.md
